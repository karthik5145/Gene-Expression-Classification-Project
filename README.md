Dataset Description:

The gene expression dataset consists of various alpha and cold condition measurements over time, along with some other attributes. The last three columns seem to indicate the function, class, and gene name.


Understanding the intricate relationship between gene expression patterns and biological phenotypes is crucial in deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying various cellular processes. 
In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach for predictive classification of baker's yeast gene expression data. 
In the realm of data mining, classification is a fundamental technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. When it comes to classifying bakers yeast, which is essential in various culinary and scientific endeavors, data mining techniques can offer valuable insights.
Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks, were trained on the selected features to predict different classifications of interest, such as disease states or metabolic activities.
