Dataset Description:

The gene expression dataset consists of various alpha and cold condition measurements over time, along with some other attributes. The last three columns seem to indicate the function, class, and gene name.

Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes:

To use this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. These packages can be installed using pip. You can run this project in Google Colab for easy access to resources and interactive coding.

First, upload the dataset brown-selected.tab directly to Colab using the file upload widget or access it from Google Drive. The dataset is then cleaned by removing metadata and descriptions, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features. 

Understanding the intricate relationship between gene expression patterns and biological phenotypes is crucial in deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying various cellular processes. 
In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach for predictive classification of baker's yeast gene expression data. 
In the realm of data mining, classification is a fundamental technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. When it comes to classifying bakers yeast, which is essential in various culinary and scientific endeavors, data mining techniques can offer valuable insights.
Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks, were trained on the selected features to predict different classifications of interest, such as disease states or metabolic activities.
